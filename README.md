Mini-Project-3: Text Layout

The project includes multiple files:
Ones provided by prof.Rebelsky and sometimes slightly modified:
- BoxedBlock.java
- HComposition.java
- VComposition.java
- MathExpt.java
- MathUtils.java
- TBExpt.java
- TBUtils.java

And ones created mainly by me:
- Centered.java
- HorizontallyFlipped.java
- Original.java
- RightJustified.java
- Truncated.java
- VerticallyFlipped.java
- Testing.java

One could wonder - why so many files? And the answer is simple: because we love modifying the textBlocks and want to see them modified in as many ways as possible and then test them all. This is essentially what happens in this project. The correctness of modifications of textBlocks is measured by eq, eqv and equal methods implemented in interfaces of each of the block-modifier classes as well as TBUtils.
